###Slight delays

We've been working hard to launch the Helpd.me app to the world, but after making a change of framework earlier in the year to allow for easier modular development and deployment, the development has run slightly behind.

Adding into this a few other priority projects for our team, the launch of this service hasn't been moving as quickly as initially hoped.

As such, we'll be picking up the pace in the new year prepping for a closed alpha and open beta readying for launch by the end of 2016!
